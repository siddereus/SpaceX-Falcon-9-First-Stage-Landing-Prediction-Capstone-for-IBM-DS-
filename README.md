# SpaceX-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction-Capstone-for-IBM-DS-

This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to predict whether SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket’s first stage will successfully land after launch. The reusability of Falcon 9’s first stage plays a key role in reducing the cost of space exploration, and an accurate prediction of landing success can help optimize rocket reusability.

The project involves several key steps:

__Data Collection:__ Historical launch data is gathered from SpaceX’s public API and web scraping techniques. This includes details on launch dates, mission types, payload masses, landing status, and more.

__Data Preprocessing:__ Data is cleaned and transformed, handling missing values and standardizing numerical features. Additionally, categorical variables such as landing success are encoded for use in machine learning models.

__Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):__ A thorough analysis of the dataset is performed to uncover trends, correlations, and key features influencing the success or failure of landings.

__Model Development:__ Various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), are trained and tuned using grid search and cross-validation techniques to find the best hyperparameters.

__Evaluation:__ Models are evaluated based on their accuracy and confusion matrices to assess their performance in predicting landing success.

The ultimate goal is to predict the likelihood of a successful landing based on mission-specific features, which can be valuable for reducing operational costs and competing with other space launch providers. The models built in this project help SpaceX assess the probability of reusing Falcon 9 rockets efficiently, making them a key factor in their cost-reduction strategy for space exploration.

This project leverages Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib to handle data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization. The insights derived from this model can potentially impact the economics of future space missions by providing better predictions for launch success.
